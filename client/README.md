# Throw A Dart At A Map

This is a web app that allows you to throw a dart at a map. Wherever the dart lands, you simply must travel to that location. 

## Plan
- Place marker at closest major location
- Add "More in area" button
    - When clicked, show a list of nearby places from the Google Places API
- Display information about the closest major location in a box to the side of the map
